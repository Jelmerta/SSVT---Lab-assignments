-- Testing properties strength
-- In this exercise we will compare the strength of different properties.
-- To verify whether a property q is stronger than property p on some domain S,
-- we have to check for every element e in domain S that if q(e) holds, then p(e) should also hold.
-- If it is also the case that when p(e) holds then q(e) holds, then the two properties are equivalent.

-- a) Implement all properties from the Exercise 3 from Workshop 2
--    as Haskell functions of type Int -> Bool.
--    Consider a small domain like [(âˆ’10)..10].

-- All four properties have the same definition:
prop_evenAndGreaterThan3, prop_even, prop_evenOrGreaterThan3, prop_evenAndGreaterThan3OrEven :: Integer -> Bool
-- Implementations of the different properties:
prop_evenAndGreaterThan3 n = even n && (n > 3)
prop_even = even
prop_evenOrGreaterThan3 n = even n || (n > 3)
prop_evenAndGreaterThan3OrEven n = prop_evenAndGreaterThan3 n || even n -- This has the same effect as simply checking even

-- We can define a function that provides us with an ordering when two functions with the same definition are provided in the given domain
-- Note: properties may be incomparable

    -- If compar of two properties is equal, it does not matter if GT or LT is reached, as the property will be on one side of the other property.
    -- This does not account for incomparable. It would probably be better if the property would not be added to the sorting, or perhaps just fail completely.
    -- This does not matter in this exercise as the properties are comparable here.

-- Sadly we can't simply print function names with type (Integer -> Bool), so we have to be clever and first find the right function to be able to sort the properties
-- To make sure we order on the property, this also has the effect of executing the function here
