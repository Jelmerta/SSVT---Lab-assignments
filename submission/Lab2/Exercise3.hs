-- Testing properties strength
-- In this exercise we will compare the strength of different properties.
-- To verify whether a property q is stronger than property p on some domain S,
-- we have to check for every element e in domain S that if q(e) holds, then p(e) should also hold.
-- If it is also the case that when p(e) holds then q(e) holds, then the two properties are equivalent.

                    -- a) Implement all properties from the Exercise 3 from Workshop 2
--    as Haskell functions of type Int -> Bool.
--    Consider a small domain like [(âˆ’10)..10].

-- Property 1
evenAndGreaterThan3 :: Integer -> Bool
evenAndGreaterThan3 n = even n && (n > 3)

-- Property 2
-- The even property is part of the Prelude library. It could simply be implemented as x `mod` 2 == 0

-- Property 3
evenOrGreaterThan3 :: Integer -> Bool
evenOrGreaterThan3 n = even n || (n > 3)

-- Property 4: This has the same effect as simply checking even, but just to be very explicit:
evenAndGreaterThan3OrEven :: Integer -> Bool
evenAndGreaterThan3OrEven n = evenAndGreaterThan3 n || even n
